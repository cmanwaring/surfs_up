# Surfs Up!
## Overview:
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy determine if it weather would permit an ice cream surf shop to be viable year-ruond in Oahu, Hawaii. W. Avy wanted to take a closer look at temperatures during the months of June and December, to get a better idea what the extreme months would look like for the ice cream surf shop.

##Results:
  - Average Temperatures:
  -  - June: 74.9°F
  -  - December: 71.0°F
  - Standard Deviation:
  -  - June: 3.26
  -  - December: 3.75
  - Count:
  -  - June: 1700
  -  - December: 1517

Upon closer inspection, there is not much variance between June and December. The average temperature in June is 74.9°F, whereas the average temperature in December is 71.0°F. I did notice that the rance of temperatures is slightly wider for the month of December (56°F-83°F) vs June (64°F-85°F).





There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
Summary:






There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)

 The weather may be less predictable in December, and sales may decline if the temperature is 56F for the day. Although, I don't think that the few cooler days during December will have much off an impact on the overall numbers for the year.
