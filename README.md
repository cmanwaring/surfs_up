# Surfs Up!
## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy determine if weather would permit an ice cream surf shop to be viable year-ruond in Oahu, Hawaii. W. Avy wanted to take a closer look at temperatures during the months of June and December, to get a better idea what the extreme months would look like for the ice cream surf shop.

## Results:
  - Average Temperatures:
  -  - June: 74.9°F
  -  - December: 71.0°F
  - Standard Deviation:
  -  - June: 3.26
  -  - December: 3.75
  - Count:
  -  - June: 1700
  -  - December: 1517

## Summary:
Upon closer inspection, there is not much variance between June and December seasons. The average temperature in June is 74.9°F, whereas the average temperature in December is 71.0°F. I did notice that the range of temperatures is wider for the month of December (56°F-83°F) vs June (64°F-85°F). While max temperature in June is only 2°F warmer, the minimum in December is 8°F cooler. December has a higher standard deviation, so the weather may be less predictable. I would imagine the few colder days that you may see in December might have an impact on sales, but with the averages being so close; I don't think that the number of cool December days will have a large impact on overall annual sales. I would be interested to complete the same analysis on the precipitation for June and December. I think that the precipitation has a *lot* to do with the stable temperatures year-round, and would be curious to see if there are spikes during the summer or lulls during the winter that could affect minimum temperature ranges.
